## My process

- I started by creating the design of the form using the image provided in the challenge. I then created the HTML structure of the form and the different components of the form.
- After completing with the UI, I then added the functionality to the form using the context API to manage the state of the form and to pass the state to the different components of the form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to use the context API to manage the state of the form. I used the context API to manage the state of the form and to pass the state to the different components of the form. I also learned how to use the context API to pass the state to the different components of the form.

### Continued development

- I would like to learn more about context API and how to use it in a real-world application.
- I am not yet comfortable with the context API and I would like to learn more about it.
- I will need to work on mobile responsiveness and make the form more responsive on mobile devices.
